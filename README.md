- I'm @NyxDragon, software designer and fan of command line applets. I mostly just design random software to assist in random tasks I need, nothing special.
This profile is to sit here as a means for me to promote, store, and develop my webpages, applets, and software for my commission writing and music ventures, as well as develop random small-scale projects to further my self-taught education in Python, CPP,  CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and SwiftUI!
